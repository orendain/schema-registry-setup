# Schema Registry Setup

This installs and configures Schema Registry in your HDF/HDP Sandbox.  It also installs a Schema Registry NiFi nar for NiFi integration.

Run the following in the sandbox:
```
git clone https://github.com/orendain/schema-registry-setup.git
schema-registry-setup/setup.sh
```

That's it! :)
